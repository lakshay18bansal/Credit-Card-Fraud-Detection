# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A focused notebook-based project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques, documented for an IDFC Convolve hackathon.

---

##  Project Overview

This repo provides a standalone Jupyter notebook (`IDFC_Convolve_Hackathon.ipynb`) which includes:
- Exploratory data analysis on credit card transactions
- Feature engineering and preprocessing steps
- Model training, validation, and evaluation for fraud detection
- Clear documentation of approach and findings

Apart from that this repo includes:  
- `Dataset.zip` — contains the dataset(s) used for analysis  
- `Hackathon_Documentation_Prime Transformers.pdf` — detailed write-up submitted for the hackathon

##  How to Run

1. Unzip and extract the dataset:
 
         unzip Dataset.zip -d dataset/  
2. Launch the notebook environment:
 
         jupyter notebook IDFC_Convolve_Hackathon.ipynb  
3. Run all cells to reproduce analysis, model training, and evaluation.

##  Highlights

- Performed EDA to understand fraud patterns
- Engineered relevant features (e.g., transaction amounts, timestamps, user behavior)
- Trained and evaluated ML models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest)
- Generated performance metrics & visualizations to assess effectiveness
